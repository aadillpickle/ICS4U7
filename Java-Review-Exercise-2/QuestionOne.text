Right now the program does not take into account ages that are exactly 18 or 65 and does not take into account negative numbers as input.
Ages cannot be negative but right now, if a user enters a negative number, they will be told that they are a child when, in real life, we don't have negative ages. 
(At most, you can say someone is -0.75 years old when they're in the womb.)
To fix this, the first line should be changed to the following:
if (age >= 0 && age < 18) {//code here}

And if I were to input those ages (18 and 65), the program would output nothing. 
To fix this, the first else if statement should be changed to have inclusive less than and greater than operators.
Ex: else if (age =< 18 && age =< 65) {//code here}.
