a. long to double -> no
b. byte to char -> yes
c. float to double -> no

Essentially, numeric types are automatically casted to one another as 
long as the type they're casted to holds more decimal places than the original type.
Strings and chars have to be explicitly converted, even to each other, as well as any numeric types.
